awkwardly obliges by transporting you in his bike basket.  With your alien
powers and lack of patience, you imbue the bicycle with levitation and float

casing you to forget you're levitation,  bringing the bike crashing back down 
to earth and wiping both you out in gruesome form
'''

Once you have shapeshifted into a dog, you eat all of the peanut butter in the world, but since you are an alien,
you have simply stored it, not digested it, and bring it back to your alien overlords
